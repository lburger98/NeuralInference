This is an example to demonstrate a very simple form of grammar induction where we observe strings and have to infer the underlying generating process. 

There are two version: 
- Stochastic uses stochastic primitives and simulation in order to evaluate the likelihood. 
- Exhaustive uses primitives that manipulate the entire probability distribution. These tend to be faster.
