Examples
========

All examples here use the same format: a directory containing at least the following files:

    + Hypothesis - contains a functionc called make_hypothesis(...) to create an initial hypothesis
    + Data - contains a function called make_data(...) to create data
    
Note that each of these required functions can take arguments, but should perform reasonably under no args. That's what Demo does.
