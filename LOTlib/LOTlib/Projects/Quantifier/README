This file contains code for learning a system of quantifiers. There are two basic approaches:
	
	- In Gibbs, we enumerate a "small" space of single word meanings and do gibbs over their assignments into a
	lexicon. The enumeration is done by EnumerateTrees.py, writing the file all_trees.pkl (a UniquePriorityQueue,
	although it could have been a list). The Search_UnoptimizedGibbs is a simpler implementation, but super slow.
	Search_VectorizedGibbs is super fast but more confusing. Both output a list of hypotheses which should be
	re-evaluated by Evaluate_MPI. TODO: This whole pipeline has not been extensively tested, and is still in
	development.
	
	- In MCMC we do the tree-regeneration MCMC over all word simultaneously. This tends to work less well and is very
	 slow, but easy to understand.

NOTE: For MPI, we must go through the right directory that is mounted on each computer (e.g.
/home/piantado/Desktop/mit instead of /home/piantado/mit/)
