Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
==============================

This implements a version of MCTS where the possible expansions at each node of the tree are treated like multi-arm bandits (conditioned on the entire tree above). The goal is to adequately balance exploration and exploitation. The default code performs an estimate of the expected payoff. 

Subclasses are included that:
	- Make the summary statistic (xbar) for a state the max posterior found so far (MaxScoreState)
	- Use expected likelihood rather than expected posterior (LikelihoodLOTHypothesisState)

All code is highly experimental and is the object of ongoing development.
